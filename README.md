# Quick Starter for PixiJs and Typescript

Based on :
- Typescript
- Webpack
- PixiJs for graphics
- Howl for sound
- Jest for testing

It took me a half-day to figure how to make PixiJS work in Typescript, even though they provide the type bindings.  It's pretty awesome.

Hopefully this example will save you some time.

Clone it, run 'npm i', then 'npm run build'.  Point your browser to
the directory you cloned into (probably 'pixijs-typescript-starter)
and you should see some action.
